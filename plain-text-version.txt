Head Sushi Chef

The finest sushi in Japan, the way it’s meant to be eaten, is unadorned, like a flower. It’s whole, unadorned, it’s just good sushi, my friend.

Our sushi bar has some amazing sushi with great variety, as well as dishes from other Asian regions including Korea, Japan, Thailand and Cambodia. We get our ingredients from local producers whenever possible.
